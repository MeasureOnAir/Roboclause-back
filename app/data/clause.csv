(a)       an  extension  of  time  for  any  such  delay,  if  completion  is  or  will  be  delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and
(b)      payment of any such Cost, which shall be included in the Contract Price. After receiving such notice and inspecting and/or investigating these physical conditions, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine (i) whether and (if so) to what extent these physical conditions  were Unforeseeable, and (ii) the matters  described in sub­ paragraphs (a) and (b) above related to this extent.
However, before additional Cost is  finally  agreed or determined under sub­ paragraph (ii). the Engineer may  also review whether other physical conditions  in similar parts of the Works (if any) were more favourable than could reasonably have been foreseen when the Contractor submitted the Tender. If and to the extent that these more favourable conditions  were encountered, the Engineer may  proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine the reductions  in Cost which were due to these conditions, which may  be included (as deductions) in the Contract Price and Payment Certificates. However, the net effect of all adjustments under sub-paragraph (b) and all these reductions, for all the physical conditions encountered in similar parts of the Works, shall not result in a net reduction in the Contract Price.
The Engineer may take account of any evidence of the physical conditions foreseen by the Contractor when submitting the Tender, which may be made available by the Contractor, but shall not be bound by any such evidence."
